        Hi! You are probably seeing this page because your kid has been invited
        to Oscar's 9th Birthday!
      </p>
      <p>
        We’re super glad to have you! The party will be on <b>April 27th at 3pm!</b>
        <br><br>

        We plan to park at the Beaverton Wunderland parking lot, then walk over
        to the nearby park, where we will have some outdoor activities before 
        celebrating picnic-style with some carrot cake. You should have seen
        a link with the message that directed you here.
        <br><br>

        Once everyone is energized, we’ll head over to Wunderland, where we will
        provide for each kid to have at least 2 rounds of laser tag and two
        dollars worth of arcade time (Wunderland uses nickel pricing, so that’s
        40 credits). Adult kids are welcome to join, of course, and while we’d
        love to have you, we have only priced in non-adult-kids.
        <br><br>

        We expect to go until about 5:30 or 6pm, depending on energy levels.
        Oscar will be arriving from Oregon City with his mom, but I have five
        kid-friendly seats available in my car and am happy to provide
        transportation (see van below)
        <br><br>
        Please let me know if you would like transportation, or if you have any
        questions, comments, concerns, or dietary restrictions!
        <br><br>
        Hurrah!
